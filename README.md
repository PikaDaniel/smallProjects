# smallProjects
This is the place where I put my little projects for you to find , watch and comment :)

Hi. My name is Daniel or if you prefer you can call me Pika. This repository is used to hold my small projects so I can find them later and for you to see that I put some effort in learning to code. In the future there will be some more complex projects but until than this is what I got :). 

If you are just a interested person in what I code:

- You can contact me here https://www.instagram.com/damndaniel_s/ if you want to know where to find the video where I learned the code.
- The link is just so I know how many people are interested Xd.

If you are a employer: 

- Suprised to see you here and welcome :)) <3
- If you want to know more about me I'm pretty sure you already have my number ;) (wink) :))
- For a little seriousness I'm glad you checked my work out. It's not much but It's honest work.
- I'm damn passionate about coding. I want to learn even more but there is so much I can do without real experience.
- Doesn't matter what I don't got for the job as long as you would be willing to give me the time and help to learn it.
- If you need a really experienced persone I'm not yet your guy. BUT [(and it's a big one ;)] if you need passion and a hard working person I am totally what you are looking for :D.
